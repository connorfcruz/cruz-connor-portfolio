## About Me

I am **Connor Cruz**, a senior student in the Honors Java Data Structures and AP Networking programs at Charlotte Latin School. I am especially interested in mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. Outside of class, I participate in Cross Country, Track & Field, and am curerntly doing AI research. My favorite hobbies are running, programming, and learning higher mathematics. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in engineering or software management in medicine.
