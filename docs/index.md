## About Me

I am **Connor Cruz**, a senior student at Charlotte Latin School. I am especially interested in mathematics, computer science, biology, and artificial intelligence. This portfolio documents my personal projects, as well as my progress in the AP Networking class at Charlotte Latin School. In the future, I hope to pursue a career in engineering or software management in medicine.
