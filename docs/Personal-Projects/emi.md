# E.M.I. - A Memorization App for Those with Dementia

## Project Overview

E.M.I. is a dementia-focused cognitive support application designed to support individuals with memory loss through recognition-based interaction, repetition, and personalization. The app emphasizes familiarity over difficulty, allowing users to engage with content that reflects their own lives: family members, important people, and recurring daily concepts.

The project was developed with the ultimate goal of balancing therapeutic usefulness, technical clarity, and emotional sensitivity, ensuring that both users and caregivers can interact with the app comfortably.
