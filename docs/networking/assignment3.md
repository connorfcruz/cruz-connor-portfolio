# Determining Security Controls for Devices

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**

Many people are unaware of how to secure their data, as well as possible threats which could pose a threat to their security and information. This activity provides an explanation of how the user can secure their devices effectively and the types of attacks to be aware of.

**Objectives:**

- Learn the CIA triad and how to keep information safe
- Compare current software versions with their latest updates, and update them to their latest versions
- Know common device vulnerabilities to look out for
- Know common social engineering attacks which malicious actors use
- Know how to defend from both device vulnerabilities and social engineering attacks

**Success Criteria:**

Fill out a guided note document to retain the knowledge of cyberattacks and defenses, update outdated software, and manage security controls and possible vulnerabilities in an Ubuntu virtual machine.

## Design & Planning

### Cybersecurity Basics for Devices (Guided Notes)

These notes primarily cover four topics: the CIA triad, common device vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks, and defenses.

**The CIA Triad**

The CIA triad is an acronym which is defined as follows:

- Confidentiality - keeping information inaccessible to those who should not see it
- Integrity - keep information acurate and trustworthy
- Availability - allow information to be accessed when necessary

Here are some examples of where each of these are expressed:

- Confidentiality is provided mainly through encryption of data, which prevents it from being interpreted without a key.
- Integrity is maintained via backup files and preventing users from tampering with them.
- Availability matters when specific people need access to data, suich as a test administered by the College Board.

CIA is very important for assessing the security of a device or network, and it can help to ensure that data remains safe.
