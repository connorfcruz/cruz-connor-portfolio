# Component Cards and Software Slips

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**

Although many people use computers on a daily basis, few know about the individual components, both hardware and software, which actually control how that computer functions. To remedy this problem, this assignment introduces students to the hardware and how signal flows from one component to the next, as well as how each software component interacts with or allows for the next to perform its function.

**Objectives:**

- Learn what a protocol is and the difficulty of conveying information.
- Know what hardware components are and why they matter.
- Know how each piece of hardware interacts with the rest.
- Learn software and their interactions.

**Success Criteria:**

Be able to identify hardware/software given their definition or function, and also know how to do the opposite.

Lyrics:

\[Verse 1\]
Yo, the brain of the beast, call it CPU,
Calculatin’ every move, every click you do.
Clock ticks quick, instructions in a queue,
Arithmetic and logic, keepin’ it true.

RAM’s the sprinter, short-term speed,
Holdin’ what you need, while the programs feed.
Temporary thoughts, fast as a steed,
But cut the power, gone—won’t succeed.

Storage, that’s memory for the long haul,
SSD’s flash, no spin at all.
HDD, old school, disks gotta crawl,
But both save your files, big or small.

\[Chorus\]
It’s the tech inside, it’s the heart, the soul,
Each piece in sync, makin’ the system whole.
From the brain to the power, every role defined,
Understand the parts, you control the grind.

\[Verse 2\]
GPU, the artist, paintin’ the screen,
Renderin’ dreams in pixels so clean.
3D worlds, movies pristine,
Gamers and creators, it’s the unseen machine.

Motherboard’s the hub, connections unite,
Pathways and circuits, keepin’ it tight.
All roads lead here, no part’s in flight,
Communication central, day or night.

\[Verse 1\]
Yo, the brain of the beast, call it CPU,
Calculatin’ every move, every click you do.
Clock ticks quick, instructions in a queue,
Arithmetic and logic, keepin’ it true.

RAM’s the sprinter, short-term speed,
Holdin’ what you need, while the programs feed.
Temporary thoughts, fast as a steed,
But cut the power, gone—won’t succeed.

Storage, that’s memory for the long haul,
SSD’s flash, no spin at all.
HDD, old school, disks gotta crawl,
But both save your files, big or small.

\[Chorus\]
It’s the tech inside, it’s the heart, the soul,
Each piece in sync, makin’ the system whole.
From the brain to the power, every role defined,

All roads lead here, no part’s in flight,
Communication central, day or night.

\[Verse 3\]
PSU’s the lifeline, feedin’ the juice,
Convertin’ AC to DC, lettin’ volts loose.
No power? No play—nothing to produce,
Wattage on point, keepin’ tight with no excuse.

NIC’s the bridge, to the net it connects,
Sendin’ data fast, keepin' all in check.
Ethernet or Wi-Fi, commands it directs,
Online or LAN-side, it earns your respect.

Coolin’ the heat, fans or the liquid flow,
Keepin’ temps low when performance grows.
Overclock dreams? You better know,
Without that chill, your system won’t go.
