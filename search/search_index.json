If the Mac is connected to the router via ethernet, an active IP address should be displayed on en0. However, if it is connected to the router via Wi-Fi, en1 should be active instead.</p> <p>Here is the output when <code>ifconfig</code> was run:</p> <p></p> <p>Note that the Mac connected to the router via Wi-Fi, so en1 being active makes sense.</p> <p>To see what happens when the device is not connected, the Wi-Fi was turned off on the Mac by toggling the Wi-Fi switch. As a result, both en0 and en1 became inactive:</p> <p></p> <p>When reconnecting to Wi-Fi, the same results as the initial run  of <code>ifconfig</code> were output.</p> <p>Reachability</p> <p>To determine reachability of websites, the <code>ping</code> command was used with the desired IP address. Two common addresses for using this command are <code>8.8.8.8</code> (Google) and <code>1.1.1.1</code> (Cloudflare). Note that with these pings, the <code>-c</code> switch was appended with the argument '4' to signify that it was to retrieve 4 packets.</p> <p>The ping command essentially sends a signal to a desired server (designated by the desired IP address), and the server sends packets back to the host device. The time in milliseconds for the host device to receive these packets is also noted.</p> <p>This is the output when <code>ping</code> was run:</p> <p></p> <p>When comparing the ping times between Google DNS and Cloudflare DNS, Google's server obtained a faster response time (18.664 ms compared to 20.725 ms). Two possible reasons for this disparity are:</p> <ul> <li>Cloudflare's host server's location might be farther.</li> <li>Cloudflare requires more intermediary steps to access.</li> </ul> <p>Finding the Default Gateway</p> <p>The default gateway of a device is generally its router. To obtain its IP address, one of the following commands can be used:</p> <p>Mac</p> <ul> <li><code>netstat -nr | grep default</code></li> <li><code>route -n get default</code></li> </ul> <p>Linux:</p> <ul> <li><code>ip route</code></li> <li><code>netstat -rn</code></li> </ul> <p>Here is the output when accessing the default gateway on both Mac and Linux:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>When pinging the default gateway, the response time is also expected to be faster because the router must be accessed before going to external servers. The router is also much closer physically.</p> <p>DNS</p> <p>To check if DNS works, one must first determine that accessing servers by IP address works. Then, the <code>ping</code> command must be run again with a text-based argument. For example, the command <code>ping -c 4 google.com</code> can be performed.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"networking/assignment02/#troubleshooting-network-issues-ubuntu","title":"Troubleshooting Network Issues (Ubuntu)","text":"<p>Device Connection/IP Address</p> <p>To obtain the IP address of an Ubuntu virtual machine, the command <code>ip addr</code> is run.

Hackers can often use exploits in the wild to deal major harm to the company as a whole. Note that even if software is up-to-date, there is always the risk of a zero-day vulnerability, as the developers of the software themselves do not know the vulnerability exists while it is being utilized in the wild.

Starting with knowledge of password strength, primarily the tenets of length, complexity, and unpredictability, allowed for acquaintance with single-factor authentication. NIST's and OWASP's differing interpretations on password length also helped for a more specific understanding of what constitutes a good password. Extending this to multi-factor authentication using an authenticator and a respective secret key allowed for the security of a strong password to be further built upon, as a new layer of security was added. Strong password development and MFA are very useful to have in the real world, as so often, users have only one means of verification (password), and passwords are often weak and vulnerable to common exploits. In the context of large businesses, strong authentication procedures are especially necessary. The activity in which Ubuntu packages were patched highlights just how many packages can become outdated within a very short span of time, thus emphasizing the importance of regular updates to avoid vulnerabilities. Similarly to strong authentication, regular patches are also a necessity for both common users and businesses in the real world. Vulnerabilities in patches, especially those connecting to the internet, can provide easy access to a user's personal and sensitive data. A reasonable next step after implementing security controls is testing in a lab scenario how weak security can be compromised. Although claiming to be a false identity (through bypassing authentication) is unethical, it is still useful to understand how people may do this in order to fight against those who perform these exploits in the wild. Password and authentication standards are necessary to educate people on in any setting, and wide-spread means to secure users would be very effective at combatting exploits as a whole.</p>"},{"location":"networking/assignment05/","title":"Data Movement and Types of Networks","text":""},{"location":"networking/assignment05/#data-movement-and-types-of-networks","title":"Data Movement and Types of Networks","text":""},{"location":"networking/assignment05/#project-overview","title":"Project Overview","text":"<p>Problem Statement:</p> <p>Configuring issues in a network requires knowledge of how the data is actually transferred, and the path which that data takes to get from one location to the next.

Students began to explore data travel by first examining the structure of a LAN (local area network), and how data is transferred within it. Next, The OSI layers were learned about to both contextualize data travel and generalize it to the internet as a whole. Learning the four TCP/IP layers allowed protocols to be applied to the different OSI layers, and using this broadened understanding of data transfer, data was actually transferred and received between two local devices. To see how this type of data was transferred, base conversions were also covered, showing how any data which is transferred over the internet is interpreted as bits. Knowledge of data transfer, especially the OSI layers, can help in real world networking drastically, as all problems in sending or receiving data can be traced back to specific layers of the OSI model, and problems can be dealt with on that level, narrowing them down. Knowledge of data transfer can also help common people to better set up networks, including options such as failsafe connections (connections to multiple devices to ensure that if one fails, a connection can still be made). A reasonable next step to take is examining protocols in further depth or exploring more how the internet outside of a LAN functions.

When actually transferring information through netcat, TCP allowed the information to be transmitted as packets between the two devices, facilitated the interaction, and ensured that the packets were sent completely.

This is because data must be converted into a network format, move through the internet to the receiver, then be converted back into a readable format. While all layers of the OSI model are important, the Network layer is likely the most important because it ensures that data knows how to move to its designated receiver using its IP address, facilitating the complete transfer of data. Overall, this project helps to understand the connection between OSI and TCP/IP because it shows how the TCP/IP protocols are inherently built into each step of the OSI layers. While the OSI layers describe how data transfers as a whole, TCP/IP protocols are the means through which this transfer actually happens.</p>"},{"location":"networking/assignment06/","title":"Types of Networks &amp; Connections and Devices","text":""},{"location":"networking/assignment06/#types-of-networks-connections-and-devices","title":"Types of Networks &amp; Connections and Devices","text":""},{"location":"networking/assignment06/#project-overview","title":"Project Overview","text":"<p>Problem Statement:</p> <p>While knowledge of how data moves is useful, many people do not know how to use that knowledge to create and maintain a reliable network.

Overall, a virtual machine may use NAT/Network Address Translation if it wants to connect to the internet if the VM should be contained and managed by the host system. NAT is necessary in this case because the virtual subnet containing the VM must route data to the Mac's network and out to the internet.

In bridged mode, a VM ultimately acts more like a separate computer because it directly connects to the same router as the Mac, rather than acting as part of the Mac. Overall, Bridged mode may be chosen by corporations and users in general to allocate a computer's resources to VMs acting as individual devices, using time and cost efficiently.

This configuration and management also creates a more secure environment. In shared mode, data travels from the virtual machine to the host system's virtual subnet, then to the host system's LAN, then to the internet. Meanwhile, in bridged mode, data travels from the virtual machine directly to the host system's LAN, then to the internet.

Ultimately, this activity revealed that local networks may be created inside of other networks, creating a chain of data movement between an endpoint device (such as a VM) and the internet. The internal IP address is defined with respect to the lowest layer (that of the endpoint device), while the external IP address is defined with respect to the highest layer (usually a router). IT professionals may use different network configurations depending on the situation to manage efficiency vs. security. In a home or lab, it may be better to use a shared environment since endpoints are contained within a more secure network. This is in general useful for dealing with secure information. However, in business and tasks that require heavy use of resources, a bridged environment may be better. However, this has the downside of possibly introducing new vulnerabilities to the host's network. In the classroom, bridged mode is likely better to use since it better simulates a real computer, thus replicating real-world scenarios better.

The first topic learned was the difference between an internal and external IP address, which displayed that a router uniquely assigns each device in a LAN a unique internal IP address, while the external IP address is the same for all devices under the same router. This was further bolstered by learning the primary types of network topology, which provided the framework for multiple activities, such as closely examining Layers 1 and 2 of the OSI Model in Ubuntu and simulating a SOHO network over multiple virtual machines. Adding even more to knowledge of the physical transmission of data (Layer 1), students also created T568B Ethernet cables which could successfully transmit raw bit streams. The most major challenge faced during this unit was the creation of the Ethernet cable, since every wire needed to be precisely inserted in the correct order. Furthermore, another major obstacle faced was that all students' VMs had the same bridged IP address since they were clones of the same root virtual machine. Ultimately, the troubleshooting and analysis required by this lesson proves useful in the real world, whether in a business or in a household. When creating a LAN for a household, it is necessary to consider which network topology would work best for cost and speed, as well as how to actually set up a SOHO. For both IT professionals and casual internet users, it is also important to know details about the OSI layers so that problems can be found and eliminated. As such, the information learned in this unit is applicable in any field which requires access to the internet. A reasonable next step would be to examine more closely the presentation layer of the OSI Model (Layer 6), learning types of compression and encryption.

Other personal devices usually have security features such as antiviruses and policies to monitor their ports, but an unconfigured switch could allow an attacker to simply connect to an open port. Being \"inside\" the network makes a device more dangerous than being outside the network. A device inside the network can communicate with other devices in the network, which may allow an attacker to potentially compromise other devices and elevate privileges. A typical device can likely see every other device in a network by default. Since there is no segmentation by default, the device would be able to see any other device in the broadcast domain, which is essentially every device on the network.</p> <p>LAN Threat Scenario Observation Table</p> Scenario Symptoms Hypothesis Justification The default gateway address of several devices is different than expected. Devices lose internet access, webpages load very slowly or not at all, different default gateway address than expected, no official changes to network, devices still have valid IP addresses An unauthenticated DHCP server may have been used to give incorrect IP addresses to the devices. This would cause a different gateway to be listed based on the DHCP server, and it would cause a different router to be listed, which matches expectations. Hundreds of MAC addresses appear to be learned on a single switch port in a very short time. Network performance is inconsistent, switch shows unusually high CPU usage, issue appears suddenly An attacker gained access to a specific port and send many invalid ARP requests. The threat seems to be centered around the port itself, and sending invalid ARP requests would add false MAC address entries to the ARP table. Some devices connecting to the LAN receive IP addresses on the wrong subnet. Internal resources can't be accessed, some are redirected to unexpected DNS servers, IP information is received quickly, DNS and gateway values are inconsistent An attacker gained access to the DNS resolution settings of the network and redirects network traffic to undesired locations. An attack on DNS would not affect the rate of receiving IP information, but rather change the information received. An attack on DNS would also explain the redirects. A previously unseen device appears inside the LAN and communicates with other hosts, and there is activity originating from a wall jack. The device appears suddenly, traffic patterns resemble a normal workstation, the device has access to other hosts An attacker connected a personal device to an unmonitored Ethernet port. This would give them access to the network if port security controls are not enforced well, and the device would act as a normal device in the network. A student workstation is observed communicating with internal systems that should be restricted.
